# web-dev-portfolio

Background:

This portfolio showcases my best projects. I constructed this portfolio using HTML, CSS and bootstrap. Since I am still in the learning process, I dont have much projects to show off. The main languages that I have practiced with are HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are 4 that are currently being shown. There will be more to come in the near future. Thank you.

Outcome:

This portfolio took me time to finish. This is the first time using bootstrap. So i was familiarizing myself with its documentation. It was very new to me.
